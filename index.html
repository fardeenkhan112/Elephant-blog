  <p> <strong>Elephants</strong> are the <em>largest</em> land animals that live on land. They are very kind, smart, and love to stay together in groups called herds. These gentle giants enjoy playing in water and covering themselves with mud to stay cool. They use their long trunks to eat, drink, and even hug their friends. In some countries, elephants help people in forests and farms. An <abbr title="Intelligence Quotient">IQ</abbr> test would show that elephants are among the smartest animals in the world because they can remember faces, feelings, and even paths for many years.</p>
