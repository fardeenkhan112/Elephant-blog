  <p>Elephants are the largest land animals and are mostly found in <em>Asia</em> and <em>Africa</em>. The Asian elephants are a bit smaller and have shorter ears than the African ones. These gentle giants are known for their <em>peaceful nature</em> and close family bonds. They use their long trunks to drink water, eat food, and even show love to one another. An <abbr title="Intelligence Quotient">IQ</abbr> test would show that elephants are among the most intelligent animals on Earth. They can remember people, places, and sounds for many years.</p> <p>Even though elephants look huge and powerful, they are <strong>kind and emotional</strong> creatures. They love to play in rivers and cover themselves with mud to keep their skin cool. When one elephant is sad or hurt, others try to comfort it â€” showing their caring nature. In some countries, elephants are used to help humans in forests and farms, but sadly many are in danger because of hunting and loss of forests. We should all try to <em>protect these amazing animals</em> so that future generations can also see them in the wild.</p>
